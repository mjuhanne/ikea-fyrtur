# ikea-fyrtur

This is a ESP8266 WiFi module PCB to be used with Ikea Fyrtur or Kadrilj roller blinds. It substitutes the original Ikea Tr√•dfri (Zigbee) based board.

Enhancements:
 - Easier and more stable connectivity with non-Ikea home automation systems (such as Home Assistant) without additional hardware hub (please see [esp-fyrtur repository](https://github.com/mjuhanne/fyrtur-esp)
 - Designed to be powered with wired 5-7.5V DC power adapter, so no more charging the battery every few months! (5V charger can be used only when a custom fyrtur motor firmware is used. For this, see [fyrtur-motor-board repository](https://github.com/mjuhanne/fyrtur-motor-board))
 - On-board 1A fuse for extra safety
 - Additional connection header allows the use of other platforms (such as ESP32 or Arduino) since now the battery compartment is empty and can hold larger wireless modules
 - Optional I2C Temperature and humidity sensor (Si7021 or HTU21D)
 - Optional Neopixel RGB-led to be used as a status LED

 - The tiny motor connector PCB should be desoldered from the original board and re-used.
 - The only self-sourced components are the ESP12F module, temperature sensor and fuse (The buttons and LED can be ordered or alternatively scavenged from the original board)

 The PCB can also be used as a plain interface board (with buttons and LED populated, with optional temperature sensor). In this case only the following components are needed:
 Connector header:
  - J1 (1x7, 2mm pitch)
 Button and debounce circuitry:
 - Panasonic right angle tactile switches (EVQ-P7L01P)
 - R11,R12 (10K)
 - R9 (120R), R10 (10K)
 - C6, C7 (100nF)

 LED:
 - any 3.5mm diameter LED
 - R13 (270R - 1K, depending on the LED forward voltage drop and desired brightness)

 Temperature sensor components:
 - U3 (SI7021 / HTU21D)
 - R6, R4 (10k)
 - C5 (100nF)
 - J6 I2C header (1x4, 2mm pitch)
